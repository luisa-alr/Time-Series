## Luisa Rosa - Spring 2024

## Instructions:

- Download all files (1 Python programs and CSV datasets (if applicable))
- Run dtw.py
- Save plots if needed
- To see the cost matrix, the accumulated cost matrix distance, the Dynamic Time Warping distance DTW(X, Y), and the optimal warping path, they will printed out to the terminal.
